# MagicML

**This repo hosts the code required for the development of an "All-in-one" software application for machine learning use cases**
I call this application MagicML as I want this tool to be ambitious in being able to handle many AI use cases all with a single or few clicks.

**Goal**
Develop a software application that performs "auto-ML" similar to the capability seen in ML.NET but extended for additional AI such as speech-to-text transcription.
Should handle tabular data, audio data and more!

**High Level Plan**:
1. Design UI 
2. Build functional logic 
3. Design and build data model, schema etc. 
4. Visualisations

**Plan Breakdown** : 
1.  A. Develop initial GUI and identify key buttons 
2.  A. Start with scikit based ML for tabular data for backend logic 3. Define and build database storage
3.  A. Schema and Data modelling 
4.  A. Create and build appropriate visualisations for end user view such as correlation heap maps, feature importance etc.

**Down the line features**: 
- Implement speech AI capabilities which I have experience in professionally.
